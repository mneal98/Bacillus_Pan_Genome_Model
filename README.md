# Bacillus_Pan_Genome_Model
This contains the relevant files for the reconstruction and analysis of the pan-genome-scale metabolic model for Bacillus subtilis.
1) The "models" folder contains the model in multiple formats as well as code to reconstruct any strain-specific model. The scripts use the "pan_model.mat" file.
2) The "validation" folder contains the Biolog Experimental data we performed and the comparison to the model, as well as a comparison of this and previous models to the Biolog data presented with iYO844.
