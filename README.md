# Bacillus_Pan_Genome_Model
This contains the necessary files for the reconstruction and analysis of the pan-genome-scale metabolic model for Bacillus subtilis, in particular the model in multiple formats as well as code to reconstruct any strain-specific model.
The model contents are provided in two spreadsheets for reactions and metabolites, and the already reconstructed pan-model is provided in .mat format.
We suggest examining the file "example_strain_reconstruction.m" to see how to work with the model.
